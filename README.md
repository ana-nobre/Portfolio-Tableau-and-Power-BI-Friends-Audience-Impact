# 📺 Friends TV Series – Audience & Cultural Impact Analysis  

This project explores the audience of the TV series **Friends** across its 10 seasons, combining quantitative metrics (viewership and ratings) with qualitative aspects (directors, writers, and iconic quotes). The goal is to analyze **which factors influenced the audience** and how certain elements became part of the **cultural legacy** of the show.

## ⚡ Advanced Features Implemented  

### 🔹 Tableau  
- **Navigation Buttons** → interactive storytelling across dashboards.  
- **Calculated Fields (with rationale):**  

```tableau
// Season & Episode 
// Creates a compact, readable key (e.g., "S2E13") to uniquely identify each episode
// across the entire series. Useful for labeling charts, building tooltips, joining tables,
// and enabling quick filtering/search by episode code.

Code: "S" + STR(INT([Season])) + "E" + STR(INT([Episode Number]))

// Standardize character names
// Source data had inconsistent casing (e.g., "rachel", "RACHEL", "Rachel").
// PROPER() normalizes to "Rachel", ensuring clean grouping, accurate aggregations,
// correct sorting, and a polished look in legends/labels.

Code: PROPER([Author])

// Detect iconic quote
// Flags whether a quote contains Joey’s catchphrase regardless of capitalization.
// LOWER() standardizes text to lower case; CONTAINS() finds the substring.
// This boolean can drive filters, highlight actions, counts by episode/character,
// and comparisons against viewership peaks.

Code: CONTAINS(LOWER([Quote]), "how you doin")```tableau

```

### 🔹 Power BI  
- **Buttons with Bookmarks** — Add **interactivity** and a clean UX by letting users **toggle between chart states** (e.g., different visuals, views, or filters) within the **same page**. This avoids clutter, keeps context, and supports storytelling (e.g., “Overview” vs “Deep Dive”).  
  - How it works (high-level):
    1. Arrange the visuals for **View A** (e.g., line chart) and **View B** (e.g., bar chart).  
    2. Create a **bookmark** for each state (View A, View B) capturing **data/visibility**.  
    3. Insert **buttons** and assign **Action → Bookmark** (View A / View B).  
    4. (Optional) Use **Selection Pane** to show/hide visuals per bookmark and **Sync slicers** to carry the same filters across views.  

- **Custom DAX Column** — Detects an **iconic phrase** in the quotes table regardless of capitalization, so you can **segment**, **filter**, or **highlight** episodes/characters that use it. This enables counts, comparisons (e.g., against viewership peaks), and dynamic labels.

```DAX
-- Returns a readable label
-- Returns a Boolean (preferred for modeling/filters), more efficient for measures and visuals that need TRUE/FALSE logic.
-- Useful for filters, visuals, and storytelling (“Contains OMG” vs “Does not contain”).
Column_OMG =
IF (
    CONTAINSSTRING ( LOWER ( 'friends_quotes'[quote] ), "oh my god" ),
    "Contains OMG",
    "Does not contain"
)
```

## 🎬 Data Storytelling  
This project goes beyond data visualization. By combining **interactivity (buttons, filters, parameters)** with **cultural context (quotes, characters, directors)**, the dashboards create a storytelling experience that explains not just *what* happened with *Friends* viewership, but also *why* it mattered in popular culture.

## 📌 Key Insights  

Audience consistency
Over ten seasons, Friends kept an unusually steady audience. Most seasons averaged between 22 and 26 million viewers, with a high point around 31 million in Season 2. That gap of about 5 million viewers is striking. To put it in context, it matches the audience size of many U.S. primetime shows (Hollywood Reporter, 2025). It’s also similar to the population of entire states like Wisconsin or Colorado (U.S. Census Bureau, 2024a; 2024b) or even a country such as Norway (~5.6 million) (Statistics Norway, 2025).

Why peaks happened
The biggest spikes were not about the directors. They came from special contexts. “The One After the Superbowl” (S2E12–13), which aired right after the Super Bowl, pulled in around 52.9M viewers. The finale, “The Last One” (S10E17–18), reached about 52.5M because it was the end of the story.

Direction wasn’t determinant
Directors like Kevin S. Bright and Michael Lembeck were behind many well-known episodes. But ratings didn’t really move with their names. The ups and downs followed the storylines and the timing—big cultural moments, not who was calling the shots behind the camera.

Iconic quotes
Catchphrases didn’t drive immediate ratings. Their impact came later, as part of the show’s long-term memory. Joey only says “How you doin’?” about 22 times in 236 episodes, yet fans remember it as if it happened every week. That shows how a few sticky lines shaped the brand of Friends and kept it alive in culture decades later.
